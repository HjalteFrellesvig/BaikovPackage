This repository contains 'BaikovPackage', a Mathematica package for the computation of the Baikov representation of Feynman integrals.\
The package is written by Hjalte Frellesvig.\
For more documentation, see arXiv:2412.01804: "The Loop-by-Loop Baikov Representation - Strategies and Implementation"\
which is published as  JHEP 04 (2025) 111  .

The repository should contain the files\
BaikovPackage.m           -  A pure text file containing the package.\
BaikovPackageExamples.nb  -  A Mathematica notebook illustrating how to load the package and containing several examples.\
README.md                 -  This file.

The newest version (4.2) contains the new functions "BPKinematics", "SetExpandAndTest", and "GetExpandAndTest".\
They will be documented in due time.
